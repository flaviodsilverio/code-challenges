/**
Forensic specialists examine spent cartridges for unique
markings left by parts of a gun. They can then compare
these markings to the ones in any gun to determine if there
is a match. A match means that the bullet was fired from 
that gun.

Given two markings, one from a spent cartridge and the other
from a suspected weapon, both as Strings, return true if they match
and false if they don't.

EXAMPLES:
Match, returns true
"| |||  |   |" and
"| |||  |   |"

Match, returns true though one is rotated. Bullets can be rotated.
Your solution should account for the possible rotation of bullets.
"|| ||| | " and
" | || |||"

Doesn't match, returns false
"| |||  |   |" and
"||| |  |   |"
 
 NOTE: Markings cannot be flipped. 
 "| ||" is not a match for
 "|| |"
